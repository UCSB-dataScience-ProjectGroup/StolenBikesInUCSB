## What is Data Visualization?
Data Visualization is any effort to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context. We use specific software to look for patterns, trends, and correlations that may go unrecognized otherwise. 

## Collecting Data
We will go to the UCPD's office. Contact them prior to going to their office. 

## Code
Our main language we will use is R and maybe Python at the end of it if we have time. We will be using Jupyter notebooks, gmaps and plotly.
